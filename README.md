# Sales Prediction App 📊

A Streamlit web application that predicts sales based on input features such as region, product details, and transaction information. Built with Python and machine learning.

---

## Features ✨
- **Input Fields**: Ship mode, segment, region, city, state, sub-category, quantity, discount, and profit
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Automatic preprocessing of categorical features
- **Model Inference**: Predicts sales using a pre-trained machine learning model (`best_model.pkl`)
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface powered by Streamlit
